# Frequently asked questions
## Can I produce and sell my own RNodes using this project? 
Yes! Feel free to use the firmware in this repository for your produced RNodes. You do not have to pay a license to use this software commercially, as it is licensed under the GPLv3. If you fork it, you must understand your obligation to provide all future users of the system with the same rights that you have been provided by the GPLv3. Please also consider contributing additional features you design to this repository, to allow others to also use them.

It is also likely worth you reading [this material from Mark Qvist](https://unsigned.io/sell_rnodes.html). Do consider donating to him if your venture is successful, without him this project would simply be a schizo fever dream.

## Write a hecking code of conduct!!
